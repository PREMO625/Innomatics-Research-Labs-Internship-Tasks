        "\n",
        "This system aims to simulate and manage a smart parking lot. It will process vehicle entry and exit logs to provide real-time parking status and insights.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Requirements:\n",
        "1.  **Accept vehicle entry and exit logs**: The system must process a list of log entries, where each entry indicates a vehicle's action ('IN' for entry, 'OUT' for exit).\n",
        "2.  **Calculate total parked vehicles**: Maintain an accurate count of vehicles currently occupying parking spots.\n",
        "3.  **Identify peak parking usage**: Determine and record the maximum number of vehicles parked simultaneously at any point in time.\n",
        "4.  **Alert if parking exceeds capacity**: If a vehicle attempts to enter ('IN') when the parking lot is already full, the system should indicate that capacity has been exceeded.\n",
